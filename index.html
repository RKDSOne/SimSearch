          <p>SimSearch is an item based retrieval engine which implements <a href="http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/%7Eheller/bsets.pdf">Bayesian Sets</a>. Bayesian Sets is a new framework for information retrieval in which a query consists of a set of items which are examples of some concept. The result is a set of items which attempts to capture the example concept given by the query.</p>

<p>For example, for the query with the two animated movies, <a href="http://imdb.cloudmining.net/search/similar=275847--Lilo+&amp;+Stitch%7C1049413--Up/">"Lilo &amp; Stitch" and "Up"</a>, Bayesian Sets would return other similar animated movies like "Toy Story". There is a nice <a href="http://thenoisychannel.com/2010/04/04/guest-post-information-retrieval-using-a-bayesian-model-of-learning-and-generalization/">blog post</a> about item based search with Bayesian Sets. Feel free to <a href="http://thenoisychannel.com/2010/04/04/guest-post-information-retrieval-using-a-bayesian-model-of-learning-and-generalization/">read</a> through it.</p>

<p>This module also adds the novel ability to combine full text queries with items. For example a query can be a combination of items and full text search keywords. In this case the results match the keywords and are re-ranked by similary to the queried items.</p>

<p>It is important to note that Bayesian Sets does not care about the actual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)">feature</a> engineering. In fact SimSearch only implements a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_of_words">bag of words</a> model. However other feature types are possible as long as they can be binarized. The index is a set of files in a .xco and .yco format (more in the <a href="https://github.com/alexksikes/SimSearch/tree/master/tutorial/">tutorial</a>) that represents the presence of a feature value in a given item. So as long as you can create these files, SimSearch can read them and perform the matching.</p>

<p>SimSearch has been <a href="http://imdb.cloudmining.net">tested</a> on datasets with millions of documents and hundreds of thousands of features. Future plans include distributed search and real time indexing.
